Python application with a convolutional neural network using the PyTorch library. The trained models have a 80-93%
range of cancer detection accuracy within a particular Kaggle dataset.

Note: This was an experimental university project in which the following deficiencies were detected:
It seems the models overfixate on granularity and blank spaces, and since several biopsy samples
have regions with both characteristics, and the sampled images were subdivided into smaller segments 
(due to time and computational limitations) the results will be biased and inaccurate for other datasets.
